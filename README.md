# Awesome people

This is a curated list I made from people I follow and I've been learning a lot from. 
They are recognized by the community for their contributions/talks/projects/books and so on.

(Struggling to divide this into categories, and getting people's "small description". Alphabetical order)

**Note**: I'm not trying to say people only know from the category they're in. Just trying to make it easier for people to 
follow the subjects they want to. 

**Feel free to contribute, please update and improve people's description!**
